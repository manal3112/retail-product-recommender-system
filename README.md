# retail-product-recommender-system

With the increased hardships in today’s world, every business is looking to boost growth through innovation and productivity. Here, our main objective is to analyze a sales dataset of local retail stores to find out which products are likely to be bought together based on the precision results of different models. For implementation, we are looking to explore three different product embedding algorithms: Word2Vec, Glove, and FastText for classification of different products. We have also designed various evaluation metrics to evaluate the learned embedding according to which, Glove em- bedding performs the best for our use case. Additionally, we have fetched dimension and weight data from a paid API ‘upcitemdb’ and tried to perform the correlation analysis between the sequence of items purchased in a receipt and dimensions of the product. This will eventually enable us to validate the Fitts’ law i.e. whether there are any useful patterns based on product size and dimensions.
